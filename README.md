# SaaS Customer Churn & Retention Analysis

This project analyzes customer acquisition, revenue distribution, and churn behavior in a SaaS product. The goal is to identify key churn drivers and understand customer retention patterns using SQL and Tableau.

## Dashboard Overview

![Dashboard](dashboard/saas_churn_dashboard.png)

The dashboard summarizes key SaaS metrics including:

- Customer acquisition trends
- Revenue distribution by subscription plan
- Primary drivers of customer churn
- Feature usage segmentation
- Customer retention behavior

---

## Cohort Retention Analysis

Cohort analysis tracks customer retention over time based on signup month.

The heatmap highlights retention trends and identifies the time window where churn risk increases.

## Key Insights

### Customer Acquisition
Customer acquisition shows moderate growth with some seasonal fluctuations. The highest signup activity occurs toward the end of the observed period.

### Revenue Distribution
Enterprise plans contribute the majority of revenue, indicating strong reliance on high-tier customers.

### Customer Churn Drivers
The most common churn reasons include:

- Product feature limitations
- Customer support issues
- Budget constraints

Pricing appears to be a less significant churn driver.

### Cohort Retention
Retention rates decline gradually as cohort age increases. The most noticeable retention drop occurs between months 6–9, suggesting a key churn risk window.

### Feature Usage vs Churn
Feature usage segmentation shows similar churn rates across usage tiers (~70%).

This suggests that feature usage intensity alone may not be a strong predictor of churn for this dataset.

## Tools Used

- SQL – data aggregation and analysis
- Tableau – data visualization and dashboard creation
- Cohort Analysis – retention trend analysis
- SaaS Metrics – churn, MRR, and acquisition analysis

## Project Goal

This project demonstrates how product analytics can be used to understand:

- customer acquisition trends
- revenue distribution
- churn drivers
- retention behavior

The analysis combines SQL-based data preparation with Tableau visualization to produce an interpretable SaaS analytics dashboard.
